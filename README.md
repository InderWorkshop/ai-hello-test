# AI Hello Test 👋

This is my first step into building AI-powered tools using HTML and GitHub Pages.  
Deployed directly from GitHub — this project is my test run for future tools I plan to build.

## 🚀 What This Does

This site currently contains:
- A basic HTML landing page (`index.html`)
- Auto-deployed through GitHub Pages
- Will evolve into a useful AI utility

## 📌 Goals

- Learn how to host tools for free
- Use GitHub as my developer portfolio
- Build mini web-based AI tools

⚙️ Stay tuned as I improve this and launch more projects!
